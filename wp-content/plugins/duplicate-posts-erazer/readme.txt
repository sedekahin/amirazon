== Description ==

This plugin has been developed by BlackMelvyn from this [SEO Black Hat](http://www.theblackmelvyn.com/ "SEO Black Hat blog") blog in order to prevent publication of duplicate posts.

It has a double use : 

* clear duplicate posts
* save database space by getting rid of previous versions

The plugin will search for duplicate titles upon post publication and remove duplicate entries from the database.
